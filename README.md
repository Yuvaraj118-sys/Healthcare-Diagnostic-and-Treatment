# 🏥 Healthcare Diagnostic and Treatment System

An AI-powered healthcare platform designed to assist in diagnosing diseases and recommending treatments based on patient symptoms and historical medical data.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Symptom-based Diagnosis**: Input symptoms to receive probable disease predictions.
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Provides standard treatments based on diagnosis.
- **Disease Probability Scoring**: Ranks possible conditions based on model confidence.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A user-friendly interface for symptom entry and feedback.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensures patient data privacy and HIPAA compliance (if implemented in production).

---

## ⚙️ Technology Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
  - Scikit-learn, XGBoost (Machine Learning)
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning models, if applicable)
  - Flask / FastAPI (Backend API)
  - Streamlit / React (Frontend UI)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git, GitHub

## 🔁 How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters symptoms via the UI.
2. **Preprocessing**: Input is transformed into a machine-readable format.
3. **Diagnosis Prediction**: ML model predicts possible diseases.
4. **Treatment Recommendation**: Based on the diagnosis, treatments are fetched from a medical knowledge base.
5. **Output Display**: Results are presented back to the user in a user-friendly format.

## 🗃️ Data Collection

- **Sources**:
  - [Kaggle Disease Symptom Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
  - WHO and CDC public datasets
  - UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Collection Method**:
  - Downloaded from Kaggle and verified for consistency.
  - Cleaned and preprocessed for model training (handling missing values, normalizing input).

## 🎯 Objective

To create a reliable and accessible healthcare assistant that supports patients and doctors by predicting diseases based on symptoms and recommending medically verified treatments.

---

## 🎮 Controls

- **Input**: List of symptoms via text or dropdown (e.g., “fever”, “cough”, “fatigue”).
- **Output**: 
  - Top 3 probable diagnoses with confidence scores.
  - Suggested treatments or next steps.
- **Navigation**: Simple web interface with back and reset buttons.

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used

- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- XGBoost Classifier
- Neural Networks (optional for deeper analysis)
- Natural Language Processing (for symptom text parsing)

---

## 🏋️ Model Training

- **Split**: Dataset split into train (80%) and test (20%) sets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold cross-validation used for model robustness.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

## 📤 Output Explanation

- **Diagnosis Section**:
  - Lists potential diseases (e.g., Flu – 85%, COVID-19 – 10%, Dengue – 5%)
- **Treatment Section**:
  - Common medications, lifestyle changes, and when to consult a doctor.
- **Visualization**:
  - Bar charts for probability comparison.
  - Pie charts for diagnosis breakdown (if applicable).
